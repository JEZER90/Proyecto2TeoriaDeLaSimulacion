    "En esta simulacion buscaremos simular una pizzeria, y seguiremos la siguente logica:un cliente ordena la pizza, el empleado recibe el pedido y empiza a hacer la o las pizzas,una vez hecho el pedido se tiene que hornar, el espacio del horno es limitado,el horno tambien tiene un tiempo que se tarda en hacer las pizzaspor lo que en ciertos momentos, los pedidos se quedaran esperando que el horno se desocupe espacios.para esta simulacion tendremos los recursos de epleado, y horno,los espacios del horno lo manejaremos con contenedores y la cantidad de masas tambien seria un contenedorrecordando que las masas se hacen el dia anterior por lo que se cuenta con una cantidad finita y se repone dia a dia como lo que estamos simulando es solo un dia de trabajo no recargaremos las masas, asumendo que el dia siguente yaseria es otra simulacion\n",
